# AES-Encryption
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information.  AES is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. It is essential for government computer security, cybersecurity and electronic data protection.AES-256 uses a 256-bit key length to encrypt and decrypt a block of messages. Each cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using cryptographic keys of 128, 192 and 256 bits, respectively.Symmetric, also known as secret key, ciphers use the same key for encrypting and decrypting. The sender and the receiver must both know  and use the same secret key.
